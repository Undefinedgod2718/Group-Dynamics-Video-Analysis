This sentiment intensity distribution heatmap reflects the emotional state of team members. We can see that most members display relatively low sentiment intensity values (denoted by deeper shades of red). However, there are also some members with higher sentiment intensity levels (shown in orange-yellow). As team leaders, we need to pay attention to this disparity and take action to build a team atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding. By listening to each member's needs, providing support, and facilitating communication, we can alleviate tensions within the team and enhance cohesion. Overall, this image reminds us to constantly monitor the emotional dynamics within the team and take a proactive leadership approach to manage and improve the situation.
